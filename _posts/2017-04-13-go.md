### Go 语言基础

#### Pointers to structs

Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field `X` of a struct when we have the struct pointer `p` we could write `(*p).X`. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just `p.X`, without the explicit dereference.

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	p := &v
	p.X = 1e9  // which is the same as (*p).X = 1e9
	fmt.Println(v)
}
```

#### Slice length and capacity

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice. The length and capacity of a slice `s` can be obtained using the expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)`:

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	printSlice(s)

	// append works on slices.
    s = append(s, 0)
    printSlice(s)

    // The slice grows as needed.
    s = append(s, 1)
    printSlice(s)

    // We can add more than one element at a time.
    s = append(s, 2, 3, 4)
    printSlice(s)

	// Slice the slice to give it zero length.
	s = s[:0]
	printSlice(s)

	// Extend its length.
	s = s[:4]
	printSlice(s)

	// Drop its first two values.
	s = s[2:]
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
```

### Go 语言方法和接口

#### Methods and pointer indirection

Functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

```Go
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v) // OK
```

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```Go
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

As a convenience, Go interprets the statement `v.Scale(5)` as `(&v).Scale(5)` since the Scale method has a pointer receiver.

#### Choosing a value or pointer receiver

There are two reasons to use a pointer receiver.

The first is so that the method can modify the value that its receiver points to.

The second is to avoid copying the value on each method call. This can be more efficient if the receiver is a large struct, for example.

### Go 语言并发

Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.

#### Generator: function that returns a channel

Channels are first-class values, just like strings or integers.

#### Channels as a handle on a service
